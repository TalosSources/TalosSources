- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TalosSources
I'm a CS student at EPFL, interested about Virtual Reality and world simulations in general (procedural generation, emergence, etc.)
I'm also enthousiast about distributed and decentralized systems, whose scale is a function of the userbase.
I'm looking forward to contribute to promising open-source projects!
