CS student at EPFL, doing a master in Computer Science.
interested about world simulations techniques (procedural generation, emergence, etc.)
I'm also enthousiastic about distributed and decentralized systems, and the idea of decentralized 3D environments.
worrysome about ML, AGI, mass data collection and advertising, recommendation algorithms, etc.
